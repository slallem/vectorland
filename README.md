## cartridge/PCB

PCB v1.00 : My first PCB batch, with few caveats:

- Holes spacing don't fit in original shells
- Solder point for 27C256 is way too small and hard to solder
- Missing cversion number
- Missing marking for parts 

PCB v1.01 (ideas / work in progress)
 
- 3 pin jumper selector instead of solder point
- Logo on back
- Version

## cartridge/shell

My 3D modeling of a Vectrex cartridge shell.

Few variants available (ZIF top, custom PCBs).
